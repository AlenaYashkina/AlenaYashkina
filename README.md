Prompt Engineer | Generative AI Developer | GPT-based Automation

With a background in technical design and lighting engineering, I transitioned into AI development with a focus on generative models and workflow automation. My approach combines engineering discipline with curiosity-driven research through tools like GPT-4.

## Areas of Focus

- Custom GPT-4 powered tools for workflow automation
- Neural architecture prototyping: GANs, Transformers, RNN, LSTM, VAE, Diffusion
- Symbolic music generation (multitrack MIDI)
- Visual reporting automation via Python and LLMs
- Prompt-based exploration and rapid prototyping

## Technical Skills

- GPT-4, ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E
- Python (via ChatGPT): Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Tesseract, Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, pretty_midi
- Automation for image labeling, metadata, and PowerPoint report generation
- Photoshop, 3ds Max, AutoCAD, Dialux

## Projects

### MIDI Multitrack GAN
A custom Transformer-based GAN model for symbolic music generation. The architecture integrates concepts from RNN, LSTM, GANs, VAE, and Diffusion models. Built entirely with GPT-4 guidance, including architecture design, implementation, and debugging.
