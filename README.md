## Areas of Focus
- Custom GPT-4 powered tools for workflow automation  
- Neural architecture prototyping: GANs, Transformers, RNN, LSTM, VAE, Diffusion  
- Symbolic music generation (multitrack MIDI)  
- Visual reporting automation via Python and LLMs  
- Prompt-based exploration and rapid prototyping  

---

## Technical Skills
- **AI & Tools**: GPT-4, ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E  
- **Python (via GPT guidance)**: Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Tesseract, Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, pretty_midi  
- **Automation**: visual stamping, simulated metadata, batch PowerPoint generation  
- **Design Tools**: Photoshop, 3ds Max, AutoCAD, Dialux

## Projects

### MIDI Multitrack GAN  
A custom GAN + Transformer architecture for symbolic music generation in multitrack MIDI format.  
The model structure integrates ideas from RNN, LSTM, VAE and Diffusion models.  
Built entirely with GPT-4 guidance, including architecture design, preprocessing, training, and sampling logic.  
**Status**: Architecture implemented, generation quality in progress.

### Photo Report Automation  
A Python-based tool developed for automating photo documentation in real-world reporting scenarios (festive city lighting).  
Replaces manual editing in Photoshop and PowerPoint:  
- Adds visual stamps (date, time, location) with configurable logic  
- Simulates basic camera behavior (resolution, grain, coloration)  
- Automatically inserts photos into ready-to-send presentation templates  
Created using GPT-4 and prompt engineering in a production setting to reduce workload and eliminate human error.
